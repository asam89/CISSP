# CISSP
CISSP Journey
Starting this journey at 34 years of age. I'm a family man, raising 5 kids with little free time. I'm pursing my Masters in Data Analaytics, worked as an indepdent consultant in the DevOps, Project Management and Security space, and want to clear the CISSP in 1 1/2 - 2 Months. This repo will focus on documenting the resources I use, and hopefully some DevSecOps Projects(Since this is GitHub) as well. I'm trying to carve out 1 hour a day to study and stay focused on it.
